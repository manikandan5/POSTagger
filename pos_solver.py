# CS B551 Fall 2015, Assignment #5
#
# Your names and user ids:
# Manikandan Murugesan and Debasis Dwivedy
#
# (Based on skeleton code by D. Crandall)
#
#
####
# Put your report here!!
# Our program performs all the functionalities of the assignment
# The dictionaries that have been used for the problem has been explained at the places where they have been initialised
# We have the learning function which reads the data from the training file and populates the learning library
# We have a Probability learning function which calculates the probability similarly
# Our best algorithm finds a better optimal solution
# Though we double checked the implementation of Viterbi algorithm, we are getting low values for that
# The output of the program is:
# Naive : 88.27 %
# MCMC : 88.14 %
# Sampling : 88.29% Our sampler generates the samples
# Viterbi : 72.43%
# Best : 93.35%
