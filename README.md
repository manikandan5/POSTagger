# Part of Speech Tagger

This code was written for the course Elements of Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-B 551) at Indiana University handled by Professor David Crandall. Skeleton code was provided by the Professor to get us started with the assignment.


**What does the program do?** <br/>
* The program tries to find the part of speech to which a word could belong from the given sentence.
* More details about the game can be found from this [link](https://github.com/manikandan5/POSTagger/blob/master/Question.pdf).

**How does it find it?** <br/>

* The program uses Naive inference, Sampling, MCMC sampling  and Viterbi algorithm to find the part of speech.

Detailed explanation about how the code works and the reason why we chose this implementation could be found [here](https://github.com/manikandan5/POSTagger/blob/master/pos_solver.py).
